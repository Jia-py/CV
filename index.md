## SRTP National Innovation Training (Comprehensive Analysis of Urban Livability Based on the Combination of Time and Space Big Data)

_Team Leader, 05/2019 - 05/2020_

advised by Prof. [Zhenhong Du](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhenhongzju)

* Processed and screened POI data with spark; Constructed evaluation indicators for livable cities; Visualized the livability of cities
* Mastered the Arcmap software to spatially connect point data with city boundary data
* Adopted Arcmap and Python for data visualization and comprehensive analyses of city livability

## ZJU Earth Big Data Research Program

_Research Assistant, 06/2020 - 07/2020 & 11/2020 - 06/2021_

advised by Hundred-Talent Program Researcher [Zhou Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhangzhou)

programme video channel: [ZJU_Earth_Data](https://space.bilibili.com/616904352?from=search&seid=626336702640278886&spm_id_from=333.337.0.0)

* Used python to Collect the rock data in the geological literature; Established the biggest open source diamond database
* Judged the origin based on the composition of diamond using machine learning; Analyzed the composition pattern of diamond

## BSc Thesis (A data-driven study of mantle diamonds and their inclusions)

Evaluation: 4.2/5.0

advised by Hundred-Talent Program Researcher [Zhou Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhangzhou)

* We establish a diamond database through the Python script and the artificial screening and enters the data into the database as complete as possible. The database is open to global researchers, helping solve the scarcity of diamond data.
* We introduce the machine learning model into the classification problem for diamonds and their inclusions. Comparisons are made between the basic machine learning methods with the frontier machine learning models (such as XGBoost and LightGBM) to obtain a high classification accuracy. The study investigates the best feature for classification providing information on the similarity of cratons.
* Diamonds locality motions are visualized in the plates through the GPLATES platform for further research on diamond similarity.

## LA COVID-19 Prediction Model

_Research Assistant, 03/2021 - now_

advised by Prof. [Ling Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/lc)

* we build graphs in high spatial resolution units based on fine-grained mobility data and COVID-19 infections data to predict the number of newly added infections.
* We introduce a spatial weighted aggregation module to aggregate the embeddings from lower level geographic layer to higher level geographic layer.
