* Won the second prize and the opportunity to participate in the conference IM Data 2020
* Evaluated the risk of viral infection in the areas around Los Angeles using multi-index evaluation system


## ZJU Earth Big Data Research Program
_Research Assistant, 06/2020 - 07/2020 & 11/2020 - 06/2021_
* Used python to Collect the rock data in the geological literature; Established the biggest open source diamond database
* Judged the origin based on the composition of diamond using machine learning; Analyzed the composition pattern of diamond


## BSc Thesis (A data-driven study of mantle diamonds and their inclusions)

* We establish a diamond database through the Python script and the artificial screening and enters the data into the database as complete as possible. The database is open to global researchers, helping solve the scarcity of diamond data.
* We introduce the machine learning model into the classification problem for diamonds and their inclusions. Comparisons are made between the basic machine learning methods with the frontier machine learning models (such as XGBoost and LightGBM) to obtain a high classification accuracy. The study investigates the best feature for classification providing information on the similarity of cratons.
* Diamonds locality motions are visualized in the plates through the GPLATES platform for further research on diamond similarity.
